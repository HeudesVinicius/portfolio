                <p>In my childhood I was never one to stand out, but I learned that everything started with a decision, so from a certain day I decided that I would focus more on myself, my future and the realization of my dreams and goals, looking for a better version of me every day. So, if I want to talk about motivation and who is responsible for it, I can say with certainty that in addition to my family and friends support, one of my biggest motivations is myself. Because I'm the one who charges me every day, I'm the one who commands my thoughts, focusing on giving my best today so that tomorrow I can reap a little bit of yesterday's result.</p>
